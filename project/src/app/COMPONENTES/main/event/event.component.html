    Tire Technology Expo has grown in strength and stature every year since it

    conference and exhibition staged in February 2014 universally praised it as
    the 'world's leading tire design and tire manufacturing event', noting in
    particular the outstanding quality of the conference papers and speakers,
    and the comprehensive extent of machinery manufacturers and suppliers who
    exhibited at the event.
